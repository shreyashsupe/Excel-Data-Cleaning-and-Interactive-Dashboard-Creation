## Overview
This project demonstrates the use of Excel for comprehensive data cleaning, transformation, and dashboard creation. I worked with a dataset containing customer demographic and transactional data to create insightful visualizations and an interactive dashboard. This project highlights the power of Excel in handling complex data, performing advanced analysis, and presenting it in a user-friendly format.

## Features
1. Data Cleaning: Removed duplicates, replaced coded values, and standardized formats.
2. Advanced Data Categorization: Created custom categories (like age brackets) using nested IF statements.
3. Pivot Tables: Summarized key data points for analysis.
4. Visualizations: Bar charts, line charts, and pie charts to represent key trends.
5. Interactive Dashboard: Included slicers for dynamic filtering of data.

## Project Breakdown
1. Data Preparation and Cleaning
    Ensured raw data integrity by working on a separate sheet.
    Removed duplicates and standardized numerical formats.
    Replaced coded values (e.g., "M" for Married) with full-text equivalents.

2. Data Analysis and Visualization
    Created age brackets using nested IF statements for more insightful data segmentation.
    Built multiple pivot tables to summarize data.
    Created various visualizations, including:
    Bar Chart: Displaying average income by gender and bike purchase status.
    Line Chart: Showing bike purchases by age groups.
    Pie Chart: Representing customer commute distances.

3. Dashboard Assembly
    Combined all visualizations into a cohesive, easy-to-navigate dashboard.
    Integrated slicers for interactive filtering and real-time data analysis.

4. Tools & Techniques
    Microsoft Excel: Used for data cleaning, transformation, and visualization.
    Pivot Tables: Created to summarize data points.
    Nested IF Statements: Utilized for advanced data categorization.
    Bar, Line, and Pie Charts: Built to visualize trends within the dataset.
    Slicers: Added to enable interactive filtering within the dashboard.

## Project File Structure
1. Raw_Data_Sheet: Contains unmodified raw data.
2. Pivot_Tables_Sheet: Contains summarized data via pivot tables.
3. Dashboard_Sheet: Final interactive dashboard with visualizations and slicers.

## Conclusion
This project showcases how Excel can be utilized to transform raw data into a powerful, interactive dashboard. The project emphasizes data cleaning, analysis using pivot tables, and user-friendly visualizations for decision-making.
